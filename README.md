## Introduction

In today's world, robots are being increasingly used in various applications, including hazardous environments where human presence may be dangerous or impractical. This project focuses on developing a mobile robot capable of detecting potential hazards, such as obstacles, cliffs, or moving objects, and reacting accordingly.

The robot will be equipped with a combination of sensors, such as LiDAR, cameras, and inertial measurement units (IMUs), to perceive its surroundings. Using advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, the robot will analyze the sensor data in real-time to identify potential hazards and determine the appropriate course of action.

## Features
- Real-time hazard detection using Camera 
- object clasification using openvc
- Integration with ros2 and simulation in Gazebo 
- Extensibility and modularity for adding new sensors or features
